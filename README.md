Program uses external sites such as: Google sheets, sheety and nutrix.
Data provided by the user is then processed by nutrix, that catches activity logs from plain text and then converts it into format, that we're interested in.
Then, all the data, separated into single activities is being placed into your Google sheet using sheety apikey.
All the apikeys required for this code are free to use and easy to get. All you need to do is google it, copy paste it into the code, and you're ready to go!
